This version is based on v0.2
I refactored most code to use rtl-generics.
- speed improvements
- type safety

Also this version is cross-platform. Compiles on all platforms supprted by Lazarus.

Enjoy,

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This is based on above and Gold_Parser_5 lazarus package,
this was done because I found (may be for unknowledge)
that for very simple grammar for 5/3 the original version fails and
the example for Gold_Parser_5 worked fine.

The grammar was create with GoldParser Builder and saved as cgt.
